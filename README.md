Made a functional EmberBot using Discord.py

Current Admin commands (user invoking the command must have Administrator permissions within any of their roles):

!group new {name} {#}
!group list (Unavailable)
!group delete (Unavailable)

Name MUST include the wildcard character if you want to make more than one channel (currently ?)
Ex: !group new saturday-? 22 will make 22 text + voice channels and roles from saturday-1 to saturday-22
Current user commands:

!group set {name}
Name must match an existing channel AND role to be given out (will not match with key roles like Exec, Mentor or President no matter what)
